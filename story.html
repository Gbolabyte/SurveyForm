                         In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development" target="_blank">software development</a> and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software[1] Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers, or development team members.

User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.

   <li><strong>1998:</strong> Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined <br>the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
<li><strong>1999:</strong> Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained,<br> introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
<li><strong>2001:</strong> Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:</li>
   <ul> <li>The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;</li>
     <li>The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). <br>It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
     <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li>
        </ul>
<li><strong>2001:</strong> The XP team at Connextra[6] in London devised the user story format and<br> shared examples with others.</li>
<li><strong>2004:</strong> Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards<br> in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard<br> reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of<br> user stories. While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a <br>whole with the invention.</li>
<li><strong>2014:</strong> After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published<br> the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the<br> identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to <br>their interdependence</li>

                              <p>  User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.
